# IPythonDisplayTurtle
An implementation of the classic turtle module mainly implemented using IPython.display, IPython.HTML, and paperscript. Can be used with Jupyter Notebooks, and in places where ipywidgets are not supported. Only requires one way communication to work, so great for remote server cases.
