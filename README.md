# IPythonDisplayTurtle
An implementation of the classic turtle module mainly implemented using IPython.display, IPython.HTML, and paperscript. 
Can be used with Jupyter Notebooks, and in places where ipywidgets are not supported. Only requires one way communication to work, so great for remote server cases.
Also has level drawing capabilities. You can check the source code yourself for more info!

How to install from a terminal/command prompt:

	pip install IPythonDisplayTurtle
	
To install from a jupyter notebook cell:

	!pip install IPythonDisplayTurtle

How to use:
```python
from IPythonDisplayTurtle import Snake

colours=["red","orange","yellow","green","blue","purple"]
divisions = 12
angle = 360/divisions 

t = Snake(_pendown = 0)
for i in range(divisions):
    if(i%2 == 0):
        t.pendown()
        t.pencolor(colours[int(i/2)%len(colours)])
    else:
        t.penup()
    t.goforward(300/divisions)
    t.turnright(angle)
t.penup()
t.goforward(120)
t.turnright(360)

t.display()
```
